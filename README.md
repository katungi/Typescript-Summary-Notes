# TYPESCRIPT Summary Notes

Hi there Stranger,

My name is Daniel Dennis üòÉ

I am an aspiring Typescript wizard ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

These are my personal notes as I learn Ts. I am writing them as I read from different Video and Written Sources.

**_NOTE_** I will list the Material For References later. (But feel free to Add them as a Contribution via a PR)

## Why Write A Summary

I wrote this summary for one reason. Reading without writing for me can be boring.

This summary also helps by:

- Acting as a reference material for the future
- Giving a short and quick intro to TypeScript

## Table of Contents
