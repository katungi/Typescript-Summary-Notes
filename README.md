# TYPESCRIPT Summary Notes

Hi there Stranger,

My name is Daniel Dennis üòÉ

I am an aspiring Typescript wizard ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

These are some simple to follow summary notes for Typescript. I am writing them as I learn from different Videos and Written Sources.

**_NOTE_** Feel free to Add any Recommended Learning Resource as a Contribution via a PR)

## Why Write A Summary

I wrote this summary because reading without writing for me can be boring.

This should however not be used as the main learning resource some of the explanations to the concepts are a bit shallow.
Rather, use this Repo as a complimentary tool and a guide as you Learn TS.

This summary also helps by:

- Acting as a reference material for the future
- Giving a short and quick intro to TypeScript
- Eliminate the jargon and go straight to the point
- Making it easier for someone else to learn TS
