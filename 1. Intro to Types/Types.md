# Types

There are 2 types of types, they are:

- Primitive Types -> are all the very basic types like number, bool, undefined.
- Object Types -> any types you create or types that are built into TS

Object types can modify native types and Primitive types stay the same.

## Why care about types?

- Types are used by the compiler to analyze out code for errors.
- They allow us to understand what values are flowing around our code base.

## When to use Types

WE USE THEM EVERYWHERE!
