# Type Annotation and Inference

Type annotations -> This is code we add to tell Ts what type of value a variable will refer to.

Type Inference -> This is when Ts, tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to.

## But wait - Doesn't that conflict?

We are tring to tell typescript the type, but it is trying to guess the type as well. That's conflicting.

### Why Do we care again?
