# When to use Annotation

As we mentioned in type-inferencing, there are 3 scnerios you would want to perform type annotation.

## Function that returns the `ANY` type

Take this piece of code for example:

```js
const json = '{"x": 10, "y": 20}';
const coordinates = JSON.parse(json);
console.log(coordinates);
```

When you hover over coordinates, you will see that it is of type any, same to the value of `JSON.parse`.

> JSON.parse() will always return a result of type `any`
